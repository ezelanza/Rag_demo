    "# RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a RAG system using LangChain, Hugging Face models, and Chroma vector database. RAG combines the power of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to provide more accurate and context-aware responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "RAG is a technique that:\n",
    "1. **Retrieves** relevant documents from a knowledge base\n",
    "2. **Augments** the input prompt with this retrieved context\n",
    "3. **Generates** a response using a language model\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach helps overcome the limitations of pure language models by providing them with specific, relevant information to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites and Setup "

One of the \\nmany tools used to train distributed deep learning model is \\nKubeflow, which runs on top of Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a \\ncontainerized application orchestrator that ease the deploy ment \\nprocess of applications. This in turn makes distributed deep \\nlearning training done in Kubeflow easier and manageable. Works \\non a dynamic resource scheduler in Kubernetes for deep learning \\ntraining have been done before, such as DRAGON that proposed \\nscheduler with autoscaling and gang scheduling capabilities, and \\nOASIS that proposed a utility system with price function. In this \\nwork, we propose to combine DRAGON’s and OASIS’ approach \\nto make a scheduler with weighted autoscaling capabilities and'"

    "## Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've successfully built and tested a complete RAG system. Here's what we accomplished:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ What We Built\n",
    "1. **Document Processing Pipeline**: Loaded and chunked a PDF document\n",
    "2. **Vector Store**: Created embeddings and stored them in Chroma\n",
    "3. **Language Model Integration**: Set up Llama 3.2 1B for text generation\n",
    "4. **RAG Pipeline**: Combined retrieval and generation for context-aware responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Key Benefits Demonstrated\n",
    "- **Contextual Accuracy**: RAG provides specific, document-relevant information\n",
    "- **Knowledge Grounding**: Responses are based on actual document content\n",
    "- **Reduced Hallucination**: Less likely to generate incorrect information\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 Potential Improvements\n",
    "1. **Multiple Documents**: Add more PDFs to expand the knowledge base\n",
    "2. **Better Chunking**: Experiment with different chunk sizes and overlap\n",
    "3. **Advanced Retrieval**: Try different similarity search methods\n",
    "4. **Larger Models**: Use more powerful language models for better responses\n",
    "5. **Evaluation Metrics**: Add quantitative evaluation of response quality\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Use Cases\n",
    "This RAG system can be adapted for:\n",
    "- **Research Assistant**: Query academic papers and documents\n",
    "- **Customer Support**: Answer questions based on product documentation\n",
    "- **Legal Research**: Search through legal documents and cases\n",
    "- **Technical Documentation**: Query API docs, manuals, and guides\n"
